### Structured methods for learning Table 2-1

| Method | Uses | Useful for | Do It? |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| Organizational climate and employee satisfaction surveys | Learning about culture and morale. Many organizations do such surveys regularly, and a database may already be available. If not, consider setting up a regular survey of employee perceptions. | Useful for managers at all levels if the analysis is available specifically for your unit or group. Usefulness depends on the granularity of the collection and analysis. This also assumes the survey instrument is a good one and the data has been collected carefully and analyzed rigorously. | No? Check around but probably not available? |
| Structured sets of interviews with slices of the organization or unit | Identifying shared and divergent perceptions of opportunities and problems. You can interview people at the same level in different departments (a horizontal slice) or bore down through multiple levels (a vertical slice). Whichever dimension you choose, ask everybody the same questions, and look for similarities and differences in people’s responses. | Most useful for managers leading groups of people from different functional backgrounds. Can be useful at lower levels if the unit is experiencing significant problems. | Yes, within my group. |
| Focus groups | Probing issues that preoccupy key groups of employees, such as morale issues among frontline production or service workers. Gathering groups of people who work together also lets you see how they interact and identify who displays leadership. Fostering discussion promotes deeper insight. | Most useful for managers of large groups of people who perform a similar function, such as sales managers or plant managers. Can be useful for senior managers as a way of getting quick insights into the perceptions of key employee constituencies. | No, not applicable for my situation. Of course, will determine and do process improvements as a group. |
| Analysis of critical past decisions | Illuminating decision-making patterns and sources of power and influence. Select an important recent decision, and look into how it was made. Who exerted influence at each stage? Talk with the people involved, probe their perceptions, and note what is and is not said. | Most useful for higher-level managers of business units or project groups. | Yes, but perhaps incorporate into structured interviews. |
| Process analysis | Examining interactions among departments or functions and assessing the efficiency of a process. Select an important process, such as delivery of products to customers or distributors, and assign a cross-functional group to chart the process and identify bottlenecks and problems. | Most useful for managers of units or groups in which the work of multiple functional specialties must be integrated. Can be useful for lower-level managers as a way of understanding how their groups fit into larger processes. | Yes, need to understand our process before recommending changes. |
| Plant and market tours | Learning firsthand from people close to the product. Plant tours let you meet production personnel informally and listen to their concerns. Meetings with sales and production staff help you assess technical capabilities. Market tours can introduce you to customers, whose comments can reveal problems and opportunities. | Most useful for managers of business units. | Yes, need to go to Cincy, Singapore and NH. |
| Pilot projects | Gaining deep insight into technical capabilities, culture, and politics. Although these insights are not the primary purpose of pilot projects, you can learn a lot from how the organization or group responds to your pilot initiatives. | Useful for managers at all levels. The size of the pilot projects and their impact will increase as you rise through the organization. | Yes, good idea for each process improvement. |
